  ## Description:
  I created a burger logger with MYSQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and an ORM. And connect to Heroku. The user will input a burger into the text area and submit it. Once submitted the burger will appear on the right side of the screen. A "devour it!" button will be next to the burger just created. If the user hits the "devour it button", it will then appear on the right side. Options to update and delete the burger are also added.

  ## Installation:
  First you will "npm install", then " npm install mysql, next "npm install express", and lastly "npm install express-handlebars".

  ## Usage:
  It can be used to create, modify, and delete burgers.
